<h4 class="boldHeadings">What is ICTinder?</h4>
<p>ICTinder is a project designed by six college students that aims to help people with understanding programming languages. It's designed to match people
together that have the potential to help each other out. When a user is looking for a match he will be matched with someone that should have a higher level of skill then
the user that is looking for the match.</p>
<p>ICTinder exists for young and old to create an environment that allows users to help each other out. We strive for a calm but educational place.</p>
<h4 class="boldHeadings">Is there a minimum age to join ICTinder?</h4>
<p>There is no specified minimum age to be able to join ICTinder. Everyone that is interested in in programming languages can join. For the younger users we do recommend the parents
to keep an eye out for their child. It's important for parents to know what their child is up to and who they are talking to.</p>
