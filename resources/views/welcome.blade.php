        <h1>What are we?</h1>
        <p>
            This website is meant to help people get together, to learn programming skills from one another.
            The idea behind this concept is that you register yourself on the site, which you can do by clicking the log in button at the top, or right <a href = "/home">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you have created you account you will need to set up a profile with some personal information, and you need to rate yourself in the skills we support. 
            This means rating your skill-level out of 5, where 0 is no knowledge at all and 5 stars is a god at that skill, so other people have an indication of your skill-levels.
            Using these skill-levels we can then find you a person that can help you, or we can connect you to someone that could use your help.
        </p>
